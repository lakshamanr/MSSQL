# MSSQL Client Web Application

A web client built with **Angular** and **.NET 8** to explore, document, and manage SQL Server database objects like tables, views, stored procedures, and functions — all in one place.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

We talk about code documentation, functional docs, and design flows — but **SQL documentation is always left behind**.

We write stored procedures, and functions, and define columns in tables. Sure, we can add comments in SQL scripts, but:
- There's no native way to track where columns are used.
- There’s no centralized view for understanding or maintaining SQL structures.
- Existing tools are *either too expensive* or *too limited* for most teams.

So after a lot of struggle and spare time tinkering, I decided to **build something simple, free, and helpful** for everyone.

This app:
- Gives you a clear view of your SQL Server schema
- Helps you document tables, columns, and logic in one place
- Makes life easier for devs, DBAs, and tech writers

Of course, it's not perfect — but that’s the beauty of open source. **Fork it, build it your way, and make it better**.  
Thanks for checking it out — just trying to give a little something back to the dev community 💙
